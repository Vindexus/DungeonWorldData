# Level
When you **have downtime (hours or days) and XP equal to (or greater than) your current level+7**, you can reflect on your experiences and hone your skills.

 - Subtract your current level+7 from your XP.
 - Increase your level by 1.
 - Choose a new advanced move from your class.
 - If you are the wizard, you also get to add a new spell to your spellbook.
 - Choose one of your stats and increase it by 1 (this may change your modifier). Changing your Constitution increases your maximum and current HP. Ability scores can’t go higher than 18.
