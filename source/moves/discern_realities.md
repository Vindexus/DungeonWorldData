# Discern Realities
When you **closely study a situation or person**, roll+Wis. On a 10+ ask the GM three questions from the list below. On a 7–9 ask only one. Take +1 forward when acting on the answers.

 * What happened here recently?
 * What is about to happen?
 * What should I be on the lookout for?
 * What here is useful or valuable to me?
 * Who’s really in control here?
 * What here is not what it appears to be?
