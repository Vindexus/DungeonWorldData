#Volley
When you take aim and **shoot at an enemy at range**, roll+Dex. On a 10+ you have a clear shot—deal your damage. On a 7–9, choose one (whichever you choose you deal your damage):

 * You have to move to get the shot placing you in danger of the GM’s choice
 * You have to take what you can get: -1d6 damage
 * You have to take several shots, reducing your ammo by one.
