# Defy Danger 

When you act despite an imminent threat or suffer a calamity, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it...

 * by powering through, +Str 
 * by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex
 * by enduring, +Con
 * with quick thinking, +Int
 * through mental fortitude, +Wis
 * sing charm and social grace, +Cha

On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.
