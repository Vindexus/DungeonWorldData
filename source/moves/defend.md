# Defend

When you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack, roll+Con. On a 10+, hold 3. On a 7–9, hold 1. So long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked you may spend hold, 1 for 1, to choose an option:

 * Redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself
 * Halve the attack’s effect or damage
 * Open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally +1 forward against the attacker
 * Deal damage to the attacker equal to your level
