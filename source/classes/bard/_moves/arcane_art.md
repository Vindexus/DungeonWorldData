# Arcane Art
When you **weave a performance into a basic spell**, choose an ally and an effect:

 - Heal 1d8 damage
 - +1d4 forward to damage
 - Their mind is shaken clear of one enchantment
 - The next time someone successfully assists the target with aid, they get +2 instead of +1

Then roll+Cha.

 - On a 10+, the ally gets the selected effect.
 - On a 7-9, your spell still works, but you draw unwanted attention or your magic reverberates to other targets affecting them as well, GM’s choice
